# Heal sandbox for Windmill

## Background

Heal is an agent that turns your codebase into a production-like, testable sandbox. Then it tests the hell out of it, end-to-end.
This is a sample sandbox with specs and tests generated on the open source script orchestration platform [windmill](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill).


## How to run tests

Tests are written in Playwright and can run independently of the heal agent. They use the [heal-playwright-tracer](https://github.com/heal-dev/heal-playwright-tracer) to provide better, easier-to-analyze tracers. To run:

1. Install dependencies `npm i`
2. Run tests `npx playwright test`

## How to add more test coverage

To add more test coverage, get better bug reports, grow the sandbox for more features and add smart mocks:
